# Welcome :tophat:

I'm following [this course](https://www.udemy.com/apis-restful-com-django-rest-framework)

## Interesting things made during the course:

-  [Project to manage tourist spots](https://github.com/kammradt/tourist-spots-drf)

### [:white_check_mark:] Tourist Spots mananger
The course project intend to teach how to create APIs using Django Rest Framework. So, this API is going to manage Tourist Spots, with it's attractions, reviews, users, etc.
Further more, you can also see it running
[here](https://tourist-spots.herokuapp.com/api/)

:sparkles: There is no front-end at the moment, so to call endpoints you need to use Postman/similar app.
